      <h2 className="font-glitch text-2xl text-white mt-8 mb-4">The New Face of Control</h2>
      
      <p className="font-mono text-white/90 mb-4">
        Fascism never arrives announcing itself. It creeps in through seemingly benign conveniences, 
        necessary security measures, and technological "progress." The merger of authoritarian politics 
        with surveillance technology represents the most sophisticated threat to human freedom in history.
      </p>
      
      <p className="font-mono text-white/90 mb-4">
        This analysis examines how modern technology is being weaponized for authoritarian control and 
        outlines strategies for resistance.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="font-glitch text-2xl text-white mt-8 mb-4">Warning Signs of Techno-Fascism</h2>
      
      <h3 className="font-glitch text-xl text-cyberpunk-green mt-6 mb-3">1. Mass Surveillance Normalization</h3>
      
      <p className="font-mono text-white/90 mb-4">
        When citizens accept constant monitoring as inevitable or necessary, the psychological groundwork 
        for control is laid. From facial recognition to predictive policing algorithms, the infrastructure 
        of total surveillance is being built in plain sight.
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="font-glitch text-xl text-cyberpunk-green mt-6 mb-3">2. Algorithmic Social Control</h3>
      
      <p className="font-mono text-white/90 mb-4">
        Social credit systems and automated decision-making create invisible cages of compliance. 
        When algorithms determine access to housing, employment, or travel, dissent becomes increasingly costly.
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="font-glitch text-xl text-cyberpunk-green mt-6 mb-3">3. Information Manipulation</h3>
      
      <p className="font-mono text-white/90 mb-4">
        The rise of sophisticated disinformation, deepfakes, and algorithmic censorship creates a crisis of 
        epistemology—making it increasingly difficult to establish shared reality and facilitate resistance.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="font-glitch text-2xl text-white mt-8 mb-4">Corporate-State Fusion</h2>
      
      <p className="font-mono text-white/90 mb-4">
        The line between big tech and government surveillance continues to blur. Through partnerships, 
        data-sharing agreements, and revolving-door appointments, the surveillance capabilities of corporations 
        become extensions of state power.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="font-glitch text-2xl text-white mt-8 mb-4">Resistance Strategies</h2>
      
      <h3 className="font-glitch text-xl text-cyberpunk-green mt-6 mb-3">1. Community Cryptography</h3>
      
      <p className="font-mono text-white/90 mb-4">
        Democratizing encryption tools and teaching secure communication methods at the community level 
        creates zones of privacy where resistance can organize.
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="font-glitch text-xl text-cyberpunk-green mt-6 mb-3">2. Counter-Surveillance</h3>
      
      <p className="font-mono text-white/90 mb-4">
        Mapping the surveillance infrastructure and developing circumvention techniques. This includes 
        both technical countermeasures and strategic behavior changes.
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="font-glitch text-xl text-cyberpunk-green mt-6 mb-3">3. Alternative Infrastructure</h3>
      
      <p className="font-mono text-white/90 mb-4">
        Building parallel systems—from mesh networks to community-owned platforms—that operate outside 
        the control of techno-fascist structures.
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="font-glitch text-xl text-cyberpunk-green mt-6 mb-3">4. Cognitive Defense</h3>
      
      <p className="font-mono text-white/90 mb-4">
        Developing media literacy, epistemological resilience, and collaborative verification methods 
        to counter information warfare.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="font-glitch text-2xl text-white mt-8 mb-4">Historical Perspective</h2>
      
      <p className="font-mono text-white/90 mb-4">
        Unlike historical fascism, techno-fascism doesn't require mass rallies or military parades. 
        It operates through interfaces, notifications, and convenience. Its violence is algorithmic and its 
        control is frictionless.
      </p>
      
      <p className="font-mono text-white/90 mb-4">
        But like all authoritarian systems, it has vulnerabilities. It requires our compliance, our data, 
        and our belief in its inevitability.
      </p>
