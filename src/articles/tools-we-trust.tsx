## 🧭 Why Open Source Matters

Most people use what’s pre-installed. That’s how we ended up with a world full of Chrome tabs, Microsoft surveillance, and voice assistants that are always listening.

But it doesn’t have to be this way.

Open-source software isn’t just about free access. It’s about **freedom**.  
- Freedom to inspect the code 🧬  
- Freedom to fork it and improve it 🔄  
- Freedom from corporate agendas 💸

## ✅ Our Criteria

We don’t blindly trust software just because it's open-source. Our picks had to meet these conditions:

| Requirement              | Description                                                  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 📂 Open Codebase         | Auditable, forkable, self-hostable if needed                |
| 🧱 No Tracking            | No telemetry or built-in analytics                          |
| 📡 Offline-Ready         | Can run without constant server contact                     |
| 👁️‍🗨️ Community Governance | Built by people, not venture capital                        |
