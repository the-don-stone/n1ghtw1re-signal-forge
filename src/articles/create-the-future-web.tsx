        The Future of the Web Belongs to Those Who Build It
      </h2>
      
      <p className="font-mono text-white/90 mb-4">
        The digital landscape is at a crossroads. We can continue down the path of corporate control, algorithmic manipulation, and data exploitation, or we can choose a different path, a path towards a more open, equitable, and user-centric internet. The choice is ours.
      </p>
      
      <p className="font-mono text-white/90 mb-4">
        The power to shape the future of the web lies not in the hands of corporations or governments, but in the hands of individuals, creators, and communities. It lies in the hands of those who are willing to challenge the status quo, to question the dominant narratives, and to build alternatives that empower and inspire.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="font-glitch text-2xl text-white mt-8 mb-4">A Call to Conscious Action</h2>
      
      <p className="font-mono text-white/90 mb-4">
        This is not a passive endeavor. It requires conscious effort, a commitment to critical thinking, and a willingness to embrace change. We must become more discerning internet users, questioning the information we consume, supporting ethical creators and platforms, and reclaiming our digital autonomy.
      </p>
      
      <p className="font-mono text-white/90 mb-4">
        We must challenge the notion that the internet is a free-for-all, a space where corporations can exploit our data and manipulate our behavior with impunity. We must demand transparency, accountability, and respect for user privacy.
      </p>
      
      <p className="font-mono text-white/90 mb-4">
        We must support independent creators, artists, and organizations who are building a better web, who are pushing the boundaries of digital expression, and who are fostering vibrant and inclusive communities. We must amplify their voices and celebrate their contributions.
      </p>
      
      <p className="font-mono text-white/90 mb-4">
        We must consider building our own digital spaces, reclaiming our online presence, and creating platforms that reflect our values and aspirations. We must embrace the power of open-source tools and decentralized technologies, building a web that is not controlled by algorithms or corporate interests.
      </p>
