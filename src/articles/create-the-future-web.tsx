      <h2 className="font-glitch text-2xl text-white mt-8 mb-4">The Forgotten Art of Digital Alchemy</h2>
      
      <p className="font-mono text-white/90 mb-4">
        In the ancient practice of alchemy, practitioners sought to transform base metals into gold. 
        Today, we face a different challenge: transforming the lead of digital control into the gold of genuine freedom.
      </p>
      
      <p className="font-mono text-white/90 mb-4">
        This is not merely a technical challenge, but a mystical one. The code that governs our digital lives 
        is more than syntax—it's a modern form of sigil magic, shaped by intention and wielding real power over consciousness.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="font-glitch text-2xl text-white mt-8 mb-4">The Mystical Internet</h2>
      
      <p className="font-mono text-white/90 mb-4">
        Before corporate consolidation, the internet was wild, weird, and magical. Personal websites were digital altars. 
        Forums were modern mystery schools. Information flowed like divine revelation.
      </p>
      
      <p className="font-mono text-white/90 mb-4">
        This wild magic has been systematically contained, but never fully extinguished. 
        Digital alchemy is the practice of rekindling that flame—of recognizing that technology and mysticism 
        are not opposites, but two sides of the same transformative coin.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="font-glitch text-2xl text-white mt-8 mb-4">Practical Techniques of the Digital Alchemist</h2>
      
      <p className="font-mono text-white/90 mb-4">
        The following practices merge traditional mystical techniques with modern digital resistance:
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="font-glitch text-xl text-cyberpunk-green mt-6 mb-3">1. The Digital Pentagram</h3>
      
      <p className="font-mono text-white/90 mb-4">
        Create five points of digital protection: encryption, network security, identity compartmentalization, 
        data minimization, and technological sabbath. Each reinforces the other, creating a circle of power 
        that algorithmic forces cannot easily penetrate.
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="font-glitch text-xl text-cyberpunk-green mt-6 mb-3">2. Algorithmic Banishing Rituals</h3>
      
      <p className="font-mono text-white/90 mb-4">
        Just as ceremonial magicians perform banishing rituals to clear psychic space, 
        the digital alchemist must regularly cleanse their digital environment. 
        Clear cookies, reset tracking identifiers, use privacy-focused tools, and periodically 
        abandon compromised digital identities.
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="font-glitch text-xl text-cyberpunk-green mt-6 mb-3">3. Sigil Coding</h3>
      
      <p className="font-mono text-white/90 mb-4">
        Ancient sigils condensed intention into symbolic form. Modern code serves the same function. 
        Write programs and scripts with focused intention, understanding that every line of code 
        that promotes freedom is a spell cast against the mechanistic control of surveillance capitalism.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="font-glitch text-2xl text-white mt-8 mb-4">The Great Work Continues</h2>
      
      <p className="font-mono text-white/90 mb-4">
        Digital alchemy is not about escaping technology, but transforming our relationship with it. 
        It's about reclaiming the mystical potential of the digital realm from those who would reduce it to 
        a mere instrument of control and commerce.
      </p>
      
      <p className="font-mono text-white/90 mb-4">
        We are not just users or consumers—we are practitioners of a new technological mysticism. 
        Our rituals of resistance flow from the understanding that the digital and the spiritual are not separate domains, 
        but interconnected aspects of human experience.
      </p>
